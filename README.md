# DeepLearning_Archs_pytorch

This repository includes implementation of popular deep learning architectures in pytorch.
Link to referred video tutorial/Paper will also be included in code.
Feel free to use this as a learning resource.

There is a common generic Pytorch trainer class ( Pytorch_Trainer.py ) which is used to train architectures.

Implemented Architectures:
1. GoogleNet

2. ResNet
